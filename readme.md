# Anonymize student ID's

Turn ID codes in some unique code. The student codes are part of an evaluation
form that has been stored in Excel format. There will be two evaluation forms
so the generated codes should always generate the same code from a ID to be able
to match the two documents.

This app will transform the ID's into a unique code through hashing. This will
make sure it is severely complicated to extract the original student code from
the hashed code.
